They have both been co-moderators of a local peer support group for parents of neurodiversity and  disabled kids, which has been a lifeline for hundreds of families in our hometown. Jessica started the group in the depths of the COVID  lockdown, which quickly became a community of parents. Over time, the  group became a vibrant hub for over 400 families.</p>

However, after we conducted a comparative analysis of the supporting platforms including  Bettermode, Circle and  Mighty, and their different plans, we concluded that circle did a better  job in terms of learning curve, app support and registration process.  Even though it is more expensive, it will save our customers a lot of  learning and maintenance costs in the long run.</p>

Leveraging Circle’s intuitive design interface, we implemented the client’s requirements without the need for coding. During this phase, we translated the client’s needs into functional designs, bringing the community’s framework to life. The design focused on simplicity while fostering an atmosphere of warmth and care, ensuring the platform provided a safe, welcoming, and user-friendly experience for the community.</p>
